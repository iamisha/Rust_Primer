            <li><h2>Rust Intorduction</h2>&nbsp;

            <h3>Who Rust is For</h3>&nbsp;

            <p>Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of
                the most important groups.</p>&nbsp;

            <h3>Team of Developers</h3>&nbsp;

            <p>
                Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large teams of
                developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level code
                is prone to various subtle bugs, which in most other languages can be caught
                only through extensive testing and careful code review by experienced
                developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to
                compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working
                alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the program’s
                logic rather than chasing down bugs.</p>&nbsp;

                <p>Rust also brings contemporary developer tools to the system programing world:</p>&nbsp;
            <ul>
                <li>Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding,
                    compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust</li>

                <li>The Rustfmt formatting tool ensures a consistent coding style across
                    developers.</li>

                <li>The Rust Language Server powers Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
                    integration for code completion and inline error messages.</li>&nbsp;
            </ul>&nbsp;
            <p>By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be
                productive while writing systems-level code.</p>&nbsp;

            <h3>Students</h3>&nbsp;
            <p>Rust is for students and those who are interested in learning about systems
                concepts. Using Rust, many people have learned about topics like operating
                systems development. The community is very welcoming and happy to answer
                student questions. Through efforts such as this book, the Rust teams want to
                make systems concepts more accessible to more people, especially those new to
                programming.</p>&nbsp;
            <h3>Companies</h3>&nbsp;
            <p>Hundreds of companies, large and small, use Rust in production for a variety of
                tasks, including command line tools, web services, DevOps tooling, embedded
                devices, audio and video analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrencies,
                bioinformatics, search engines, Internet of Things applications, machine
                learning, and even major parts of the Firefox web browser.
                </p>&nbsp;
            <h3> Open Source Developers</h3>&nbsp;
            <p>Rust is for people who want to build the Rust programming language, community,
                developer tools, and libraries. We’d love to have you contribute to the Rust
                language.</p>&nbsp;
            <h3>People Who Value Speed and Stability</h3>&nbsp;
            <p>Rust is for people who crave speed and stability in a language. By speed, we
                mean both how quickly Rust code can run and the speed at which Rust lets you
                write programs. The Rust compiler’s checks ensure stability through feature
                additions and refactoring. This is in contrast to the brittle legacy code in
                languages without these checks, which developers are often afraid to modify. By
                striving for zero-cost abstractions, higher-level features that compile to
                lower-level code as fast as code written manually, Rust endeavors to make safe
                code be fast code as well.</p>&nbsp;

            <p>The Rust language hopes to support many other users as well; those mentioned
                here are merely some of the biggest stakeholders. Overall, Rust’s greatest
                ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that programmers have accepted for
                decades by providing safety *and* productivity, speed *and* ergonomics. Give
                Rust a try and see if its choices work for you.</p>&nbsp;
